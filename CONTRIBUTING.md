# Contributing to Weather App

We love your input! We want to make contributing to the Weather App as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Pull Requests Process

1. Fork the repo and create your feature branch from `main`
2. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
3. Ensure any existing functionality remains working
4. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](LICENSE.md) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using GitHub's issue tracker

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue.

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

- Use 2 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
- Follow the existing code structure and organization
- Maintain consistency with the existing codebase
- Add meaningful comments for complex logic

## License

By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under its MIT License.
